## Installation

You have three options. In order to use the first two options you need to have Phing installed (tested with 2.4.14):

- Use `phing build_archive` to generate a single zip file (`build/intralibrary-moodle-plugins.zip`) that can be unzipped into your Moodle directory *(Recommended)*
- Use `phing build_archives` to generate individual zip files for each plugin (will land in `build/`), which can be separately unzipped into your Moodle directory
- If you don't have [Phing](http://www.phing.info/), copy all directories from `src` to your Moodle directory
